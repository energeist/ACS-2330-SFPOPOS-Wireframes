## User Stories

- As a tourist visiting San Francisco, I want to be able to easily find interesting and unique public open spaces in the downtown area, so that I can explore and enjoy the city to its fullest.
- As someone who enjoys SFPOPOS, I want to receive updates about newly added spaces, changes to existing spaces and events happening at SFPOPOSpaces by signing up for a monthly newsletter.
- As a remote worker who appreciates a change in scenery, I want to be able to quickly filter spaces to find spaces that have specific amenities like free wifi, a washroom and food and beverages available.
